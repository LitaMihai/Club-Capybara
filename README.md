# Club-Capybara

## What is 'Club Capybara'?
Club Capybara is a multiplayer 3D game. I used SVN as a subversion system.

## Why is this repo empty?
Because GitHub does not accept large files.

## Why do you created this repo?
Because everyone has access to it. If someone wants to see the files, I have all of them on my PC, on a SVN server. Here I will post a video of the game and all the scripts used when we finish it.

## We?
Yes, we are a team of 5 people working on it.
